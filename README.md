# Whitelist

This is a very simple PHP Whitelist Library.

## Why use a Whitelist?
There aren't many uses for a Whitelist in PHP, but I use it to limit which links I allow to be converted to BackLinks. But you could use it to limit other things. Recently I decide to throw it in the Public Domain for everyone. A Whitelist solution in PHP was non-existent when I needed one , so I decided to make one.

This is released under the Unlicense. So do whatever you want with it.
You are also free to contribute if you want.

### Notes:
- It is a Whitelist class, not a AntiSpam Class. Even though that's what I use my Whitelist for.
- The Whitelist separates items read from a file by newlines.
- Feel free to send me any feedback, requests.
